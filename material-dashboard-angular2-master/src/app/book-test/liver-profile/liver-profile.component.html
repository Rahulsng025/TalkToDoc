                        <p>Liver function test is a set of blood tests used to monitor the working of the liver or to
                            screen the liver damage or inflammation. This test helps in diagnosing a liver disease or
                            liver condition. This test also measures the amount of certain enzymes and proteins in the
                            blood. Some of these tests are helpful in estimating the performance of the liver functions
                            like producing proteins, clearing of waste products in blood like bilirubin and some tests
                            are used to measure the amount of enzymes that are produced by the liver which may indicate
                            damage of the liver..</p>

                        <h5 style="color: black; font: bold;">Liver function tests include the following tests:</h5>
                        <p> &#10066;Albumin- Albumin is a protein made by the liver. Measuring the amount of albumin
                            shows if the liver is producing the required quantity of albumin</p>
                        <p> &#10066; Total protein- Measures the amount of proteins made by the liver. Albumin and
                            globulin are the important proteins made by the liver.</p>
                        <p> &#10066; Total bilirubin- Bilirubin is a yellow pigment in the blood. It passes through the
                            liver and gets excreted. Elevated levels may show liver damage or liver disease.</p>
                        <p> &#10066; Aspartate transaminase (AST)- It is an enzyme which metabolizes alanine a type of
                            amino acid. Elevated levels may show liver damage or liver disease.</p>
                        <p> &#10066; Alanine transaminase (ALT)- It is an enzyme which metabolizes protein. Elevated
                            levels indicate liver damage or liver disease.</p>
                        <p> &#10066;Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)- It is an enzyme present in liver, bones and bile ducts.
                            High levels of this show liver damage or liver disease. </p>
                        <p> &#10066;Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)- It is an enzyme in the liver used for estimating
                            bile duct problems. </p>

                        <h5 style="color: black; font: bold;">Why this test is performed ?</h5>
                        <p>This test may be recommended to you if you experience certain symptoms like dark colored

                            abdomen, tiredness, weight loss or weight gain, etc. This test may also be recommended if
                            you have a history of viral hepatitis or a family history of liver disease, drinking too
                            much alcohol or on a medication which may damage your liver function</p>
